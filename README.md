# bdcli
Some very simple (and likely unnecessary) shell code that allows the user to interact with bitcoind in specific ways.

## Why?
I love building CLIs, I love shell scripting and want to improve my skills, and I want to do specific things not available out-of-the-box.

## How do I use it?
Coming soon!
